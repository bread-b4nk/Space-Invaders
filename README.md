# Space-Invaders
Decided to do some Python coding while stuck at home during quarantine.

## How to run
Run this command in the directory to download the dependencies
``pip install -r requirements.txt`` 
Then just run main.py and it should work.

## Things learnt
- Using the graphics library
- Not dividing the code into subroutines and different files would've been a nightmare
- The beauty of a config file and the flexibility it provides
- Using mathematical operations on datetime's times to find intervals of time

I ran into a couple issues with making two different entities move at the same time while accepting user input, but eventually found a way to make it work. The only thing I haven't done is make the number and spacing of entities adaptable with the resolution of the game if changed. I found this really fun to do though.
