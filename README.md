# Space-Invaders
got upset during quarantine, angrily practiced my python by making a space invaders copy. Yes there's a lot of swear words I'm sorry.

Run main.py to run the thing, but you'll need some python libraries, graphics, datetime, and time.

This should be private but if someone professional ever sees this: I was 18, upset and have been quarantined at my home for 9 weeks. This doesn't represent who I am, how I act, or how I approach coding, it was merely an exercise.
I found this really fun to do though.
