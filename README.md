# Space-Invaders
Quarantine had me so bored I decided to try some Python coding again.

Run main.py to run the thing, but you'll need some python libraries, graphics, datetime, and time.

I ran into a couple issues with making two different entities move at the same time while accepting user input, but eventually found a way to make it work. I found this really fun to do though.
